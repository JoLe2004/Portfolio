                            I am currently a student at Grand Valley State University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Math, and I'm expected to graduate in Fall of 2026.
                            Some of the classes I have taken include Web Application Programming, Mobile Application Development, and Secure Software Engineering, giving me the tools
                            and skills I need to succeed as software developer. My hobbies include cooking, playing videogames, and traveling. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My short-term goals include graduating and getting an internship/job in the software development field. In the long-term, however, I hope to continue learning
                            new skills that will help me in my career. I also hope to dabble in videogame development and maybe make my own game one day.
                        </p>
